version: pre-alpha 0.1

ONLINE EDUCATION PLATFORM

This is a platform aimed at implementing the interaction of teachers and students during educational courses.

Implemented features:
1. Registration / authorization / log-out of Users, viewing, editing profiles, changing passwords, email validation.
2. CRUD courses, modules, tasks and solutions.
3. View courses created by one User.
4. Has been prepared the course registration functionality(implementation in development).
5. Attaching an independent solution to a task, including viewing/editing an assessment depending on the User's category (student/teacher).

***Simple UI/UX interface, using pastel and conventional colors to edit/delete objects buttons.

Suggested possibilities:
1. If necessary, additional fields can be added to the User's profile (last name, first name, age, gender, etc.).
2. Course registration functionality and object filter.
3. Viewing academic performance.
4. Minor improvements and bug fixes.

***
This is my final project prepared as part of a python course, so the secret key is not hidden.
